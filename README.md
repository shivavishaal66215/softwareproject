# What is this project?
This is an academic project that I did as part of a team during my B.Tech. CSE. This is just the code for the front-end. All the pages are done with vanilla js. No additional packages were used. Ofc the code could have been a lot simpler but I worked on this project while I was still learning web development. 

# Goal of the system
The goal of the system is to facilitate the easy allocation of invigilators to exam halls and to track their allotments. 

# Types of users in the system
Admin
Faculty

# Privilege of an Admin
1. Initiate invigilator allocation
2. Trigger exam re-scheduling for all faculties
3. View notifications of actions occurring within the system

# Privilege of a Faculty
1. View the current exam schedule and allocation
2. Make a request for another faculty to take their place for an exam slot
3. View notifications of actions occuring within the system

# How to view all the pages
Use the following link to start exploring:

The overall structure of the system is pretty self-explanatory. Use the buttons on the pages to view related pages. In case there is a form that has to be filled out, do not worry, you can simply press the submit button to go to the next page. 

I know all the transitions in the pages do not offer any functional advantages but they were fun to work on. 

# Re-using code
Feel free to use any component within this repository.

# Future enhancements
I will not be working on enhancing any aspect of this project.
