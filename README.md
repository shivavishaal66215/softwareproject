# What is this project?

This is an academic project that I did as part of a team during my B.Tech. CSE. This is just the code for the front-end. All the pages are done with vanilla js. No additional packages were used. Ofc the code could have been a lot simpler but I worked on this project while I was still learning web development.

# Goal of the system

The goal of the system is to facilitate the easy allocation of invigilators to exam halls and to track their allotments.

# Types of users in the system

1. Admin
2. Faculty

# Privilege of an Admin

1. Initiate invigilator allocation - Allocate Page on adminhomepage
2. Trigger exam re-scheduling for all faculties - Reschedule Page on adminhomepage
3. View notifications of actions occurring within the system - Notifications page on the adminhomepage

# Privilege of a Faculty

1. View the current exam schedule and allocation - Schedule Page on the facultyhomepage
2. Make a request for another faculty to take their place for an exam slot - Reschedule Page on the facultyhomepage
3. View notifications of actions occuring within the system - Notifications Page on the facultyhomepage

# How to view all the pages

Use the following link to start exploring:

The overall structure of the system is pretty self-explanatory. Use the buttons on the pages to view related pages. In case there is a form that has to be filled out, do not worry, you can simply press the submit button to go to the next page.

I know all the transitions in the pages do not offer any functional advantages but they were fun to work on.

# Future enhancements

I will not be working on enhancing any aspect of this project.
